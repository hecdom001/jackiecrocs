# Aguuacatito.Shop  
Live inventory & order system for a viral Crocs reselling business

🌐 **Live site:** https://aguuacatito.shop/  
🚀 **Hosting:** Vercel (Production)

---

## Overview

Aguuacatito.Shop started as a small side business, reselling Crocs locally in **Tijuana, Mexico**.

After unexpectedly going **viral on TikTok**, we were suddenly flooded with **~1,000+ DMs**, all asking for colors, sizes, prices, and availability. Managing everything manually through WhatsApp between just two people became overwhelming very quickly.

To solve this, I built a **simple, functional website as fast as possible** — nothing fancy, just what we needed to survive the volume and stay organized.

This repository contains the source code for that solution, which is now **live in production** and actively used to manage real inventory and orders.
